# Car-Kick

When purchasing a used car at an auto auction, auto dealerships face a challenge. The autodealership must determine whether the vehicle has serious issues and prevent it from being soldto customers. These unfortunate purchases are referred to as "kicks" in the auto industry.

The features of a kicked car may include tampered odometers, mechanical issues that thedealer is unable to address, problems to obtain the vehicle title from the seller, or some other
unforeseen problem. The reason dealers tend to prevent “kicked cars” from being sold to customers is that they are very costly. Since "kick cars" are vehicles with serious problems, dealers must fix them at a high cost, including such transportation costs, throw-away repair work, and market losses when reselling the vehicle.

Researchers have to figure out which cars have a higher risk of being “kicked” so that dealerships can provide the best choices to their customers and prevent financial loss of auto dealership . The main purpose of this dataset is to predict if the car purchased at an auto auction is a “kick” (cars that are bad buys).
